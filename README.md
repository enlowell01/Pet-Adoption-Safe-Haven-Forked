# Pet Adoption: Safe Haven

## This is the second milestone project for the NCSU software development program by Casey, Evan, Ligia, and Mayna.

### This is a full stack MERN application which allows users of "Safe Haven Shelter" to CREATE new adoption listings for both cats and dogs, READ the adoption listings, UPDATE the adoption listings, and DELETE them. It also allows users to explore the website with a navbar and view an About page with Safe Haven Shelter's Mission.
