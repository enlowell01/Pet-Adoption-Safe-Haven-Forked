# Pet Adoption: Safe Haven

## This is the second milestone project for NCSU software development program by Casey, Evan, Ligia, and Mayna.

### This is a fullstack MERN application which allows the admin of the mock-up "Safe Haven Shelter" to CREATE new adoption listings, UPDATE those listings and locations, and DELETE them. It also allows users to READ the listings page and explore the website with a navbar.

--- PROJECT DUE TUESDAY 7/18 ---

GOALS:

- Create the Safe Haven Home/landing page where a user may choose to browse available DOGS or CATS to adopt.
- Create CREATE page to add a new adoptable dog or cat

- Create READ pages for ALL dogs and cats available to adopt
  -Create READ page for EACH dog/cat that's available to adopt

- Create UPDATE function to update existing adoption listings and adoptee status

- Create DELETE function to remove adoptable pets. (Immediate removal? Removal after x number of days?)

- Create About Us page. Currently a catch-all place for display of group info and stretch goals (coming soon features)?

- DEPLOY continuously to a host (Netlify)
- STYLE page by end of class next Sunday 7/16

STRETCH GOALS:

- Donation to the shelter page
- Other locations/shelters
- Lost and found for pets. Would basically be user version of the admin side for listing cats, dogs, and other misc. pets
